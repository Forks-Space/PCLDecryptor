# PCLDecryptor
A tool to get account information from PCL

**I voluntarily give up all copyrights of this project, you can use the code of this project as you wish.**

Imagine a third-party minecraft launcher that requires you to pay to change the theme and download minecraft snapshot edition🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

# Usage
Put the code into your project and you can change the class names and member names as much as you want. We recommend that you use “native-obfuscator” or “zelix klassmaster” to protect this part of the code from review.

For example code, see the main function.

# To author of PCL
不想开源可以闭源，没有必要发布一个带混淆的开源软件。开源部分代码让社区给你免费贡献代码，自己在爱发电收赞助，实在缺钱改成付费软件得了。

付费切换主题和之前的付费下载快照版游戏只有你能干出来这种傻逼事了，启动到达一定次数直接弹窗主动要钱，你是什么级别的赛博乞丐？

更新还有Silent字段，是准备随时下发后门吗，有什么见不得人的要静默更新🤣


# Proof
Silent字段从远程服务器拉取公告获取，防止狗乱叫
